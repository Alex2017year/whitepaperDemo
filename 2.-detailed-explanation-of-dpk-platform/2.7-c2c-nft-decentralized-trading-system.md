# 2.7 C2C NFT Decentralized Trading System

We will provide players with a decentralized transaction system that will make it easier for players to make in-game NFT transactions on the platform. The coin of NFT transactions on the marketplace is BNB, and 50% of the all transaction gas fees will be put into the treasure fund for continuous rewards to DPK token long-term holders, and 50% will be used for the daily expense of the platform. As transaction gas fees gradually increase, the DPK team will put a larger share of gas fees into the treasure fund to reward all users.
