# Introduction

What is Metaverse on earth? Probably there is no certain description for the ultimate form of Metaverse, certainly, VR or AR games and the combination of multiple game worlds can not be defined as Metaverse. Roblox, an enclosed game, can not be defined as Metaverse. ARK: Survival Evolved which has better performance in creativity and immersive experience is a massive sandbox game that is not the form of Metaverse either.

From our perspective, Metaverse is a top-down ecosystem composed of numerous projects.

We stand up for that one of the most vital criteria for judging the meta-universe is for living rather than for gaming. This so-called Metaverse is a figurative experience of our digital existence. For life, it means that humankind must be able to have income, consumption, and obtain the resources that have an impact of reality at the same time.

We point that Metaverse is a world where asset property must be identified. It is for sure that Metaverse can not come true without blockchain and NFT.

In 2021, The presence of play-to-earn mode within blockchain games shocks the world. Play-to-earn mode means that humans can live in Metaverse and affect us in reality.

The world of Metaverse is not a world for entertainment, and should not be a world where humans pay for joy. The world of Metaverse should be a world where people can play to earn. It should be a world where private asset property can be certainly identified. The Metaverse is more than a game. DPK aims to create a digital community with access to an infinite number of universes.

We hope that in a world of kitties, we can play to earn freely without anxiety and sadness.
