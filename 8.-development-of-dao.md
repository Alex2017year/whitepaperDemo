# 8. Development of DAO

Through this platform, all players of DPK games will automatically form a decentralized organization to include every user and holder of DPK tokens. DPK will be distributed to holders so that the state of autonomy will be reached.

Step one: Minting tokens. By launching DPK and establishing clans, leaders can find friends and comrades to build a vivid family.

Step two: Staking for votes. DPK holders can stake DPK in the voting system to get the qualification. The votes they participate in will decide which way to go for DPK in future development. Also, it will affect where and how to get funds from the platform by the development team.

Step three: Carrying out. DPK holders will decide what kind of management framework they want to accept and the number of DPK needed for staking. The results remain unchanged after being made and represent fair authority. Disputes among DPK holders about key issues should be avoided such as:

Should DPK still be the currency for developing new projects?

How to use the community fund to award DPK holders or communities in a wider range?

Should DPK take part in other charity affairs?
